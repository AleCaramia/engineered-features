# Engineered Traffic Features for Network Sharing Analysis

This repository provides a set of **time- and frequency-domain traffic features** designed to capture key characteristics of cellular base station (BS) load profiles.  
Instead of using the full traffic time series, we summarize each BS with a compact 19-dimensional feature vector that encodes:
